What version of SSH was the attacker using?
- WinSSH
- Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol used to allow remote login and other network services over an insecure network. SSH uses 
encryption to prevent attackers from gaining access to sensitive data and provides a secure connection between two devices. Version 2 of SSH was 
released in 2006 and is the most widely used version today.

Version 2 of SSH is a major upgrade from version 1, which was released in 1995. Version 2 includes several important improvements, such as a stronger 
encryption algorithm and an improved key exchange protocol. Version 2 also includes several features that make it more secure, such as an improved 
authentication mechanism, session multiplexing, and increased resistance to man-in-the-middle attacks.

One of the most important features of SSH version 2 is the inclusion of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol. This protocol is used to negotiate 
a secure session between two computers and is designed to protect against man-in-the-middle attacks. By exchanging public and private keys, the two
computers can generate a shared secret that can be used to encrypt data. This shared secret is used to authenticate the two computers and protect the
encryption process from being compromised.

The attacker in the case was using version 2 of SSH, which is the most secure version available. This version provides a higher level of security 
than version 1, making it more difficult for attackers to gain access to sensitive data. Additionally, the inclusion of the Diffie-Hellman key 
exchange protocol helps prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

Overall, SSH version 2 is a much more secure protocol than version 1. It includes several features that make it more secure, including a stronger 
encryption algorithm and an improved key exchange protocol. Additionally, the inclusion of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol helps protect 
against man-in-the-middle attacks. By using version 2 of SSH, the attacker in the case was able to gain access to sensitive data without compromising
the security of the system.

Which IP Address had Port 2200 Open
- 10.1.10.33
- The IP address 10.1.10.33 had port 2200 open because when scanning the network with a port scanner, it revealed that port 2200 was open on this
IP address. This means that there is an open connection on port 2200, which is usually used for SSH connections.

What Service appears to be running on port 2200
- Secure Shell (SSH)
- Secure Shell (SSH) is a network protocol for providing secure, encrypted communication between two computers over an unsecured network. It is 
commonly used to access remote servers and is often used as an alternative to the telnet protocol. SSH typically runs on port 2200.

It appears that after running a scan, the attackers made connections to each of the open ports. Which of the following tools was most likely 
used to establish those connections?
- SSH
- SSH, or Secure Shell, is a protocol used to securely connect to remote systems over an unsecured network. It provides strong authentication
and secure communications over insecure channels. SSH is usually used to establish secure connections to remote machines in order to run commands,
transfer files, or tunnel other applications. In this case, the attackers likely used SSH to establish connections to the open ports on the system
they scanned.
