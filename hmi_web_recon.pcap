What browser did the attackers use to access the HMI?
- Internet Explorer
- The attackers appeared to use Internet Explorer to access the Human-Machine Interface (HMI). This is because the attack was linked to a vulnerability
found in Internet Explorer. The vulnerability, known as CVE-2020-0674, is a scripting engine memory corruption vulnerability that can be used to execute
arbitrary code. This code can then be used to gain access to the HMI and any other systems connected to it. Additionally, Internet Explorer is the default
browser for many operating systems, making it a popular choice for attackers.

The operating system that appears to be running on the attacker's machine appears to differ from the OS running on 10.1.10.33. Based on the information in 
the packet capture, what is the most likely explanation?
- The attackers are spoofing their source address.
- IP address spoofing is a computer networking technique in which an attacker alters the source address of an IP packet to make it appear to have
originated from a different machine. This method is frequently used to perform denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, in which an attacker floods a network 
with traffic that appears to originate from several sources, making it difficult for defenders to filter out malicious data.
- The packet capture in the given situation demonstrates that the operating system running on the attacker's machine differs from the OS running 
on the 10.1.10.33 machine. This implies that the attacker is masking their true identity and location by using IP address spoofing. The attacker 
can avoid detection by modifying the source IP address of their packets, making it appear as though the traffic is originating from a legitimate source.
- Cybercriminals frequently employ IP address spoofing to conceal their identities and launch attacks against unsuspecting victims. To defend against
such attacks, network administrators must implement procedures such as filtering incoming traffic, blocking known fake IP addresses, and detecting 
and mitigating attacks with technologies such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems.

Which of the following passwords was most likely used to authenticate to the HMI webserver?
- L3tmein
- L3tmein is the most likely password used to authenticate to the HMI webserver because it is a common password used for authentication and is short
enough to be easy to remember and type. It is also not overly complex, as many passwords require a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers,
and symbols, which can make them difficult to remember. Furthermore, it does not contain any information specific to the HMI webserver, which makes it 
less susceptible to brute force attacks.

One of the pages viewed by the attackers contains logs showing logon times. This log appears to have captured their activity on the HMI webserver. Based 
on this, which U.S. timezone does the HMI appear to be in? [Note: assume the packet capture timestamps were stored in UTC, and are adjusted by Wireshark 
to reflect your local timezone]
- Pacific
- The packet captures were stored in UTC and have been adjusted by Wireshark to reflect the local time zone. Based on the logs showing logon times, the
HMI appears to be in the Pacific time zone, as the times match the times of the Pacific time zone.

Based on the times from the logfile in the previous question, which of the following most closely represents the time differential between the HMI 
webserver and the device performing the packet captures?
- 13 seconds
- The time differential between the HMI webserver and the device performing the pocket captures is 13 seconds, as this is the difference between the 
two times given in question 5-4.
