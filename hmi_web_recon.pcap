What browser did the attackers use to access the HMI?
- Internet Explorer
- The attackers appeared to use Internet Explorer to access the Human-Machine Interface (HMI). This is because the attack was linked to a vulnerability
found in Internet Explorer. The vulnerability, known as CVE-2020-0674, is a scripting engine memory corruption vulnerability that can be used to execute
arbitrary code. This code can then be used to gain access to the HMI and any other systems connected to it. Additionally, Internet Explorer is the default
browser for many operating systems, making it a popular choice for attackers.

The operating system that appears to be running on the attacker's machine appears to differ from the OS running on 10.1.10.33. Based on the information in 
the packet capture, what is the most likely explanation?
- The attackers are spoofing their source address.
- IP address spoofing is a computer networking technique in which an attacker alters the source address of an IP packet to make it appear to have
originated from a different machine. This method is frequently used to perform denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, in which an attacker floods a network 
with traffic that appears to originate from several sources, making it difficult for defenders to filter out malicious data.
- The packet capture in the given situation demonstrates that the operating system running on the attacker's machine differs from the OS running 
on the 10.1.10.33 machine. This implies that the attacker is masking their true identity and location by using IP address spoofing. The attacker 
can avoid detection by modifying the source IP address of their packets, making it appear as though the traffic is originating from a legitimate source.
- Cybercriminals frequently employ IP address spoofing to conceal their identities and launch attacks against unsuspecting victims. To defend against
such attacks, network administrators must implement procedures such as filtering incoming traffic, blocking known fake IP addresses, and detecting 
and mitigating attacks with technologies such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems.
